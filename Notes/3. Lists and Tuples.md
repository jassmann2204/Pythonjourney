1. Lists
Definition

A list is a built-in Python data type that stores a collection of values.

Lists can store elements of different types: integers, strings, floats, etc.

Mutable → You can change the elements after creating the list.

Example
marks = [67.09, 77.91, 88.7, 54.8, 99.3]
print(marks)
print(type(marks))  # <class 'list'>

Strings vs Lists

Strings are immutable → cannot be changed after creation.

Lists are mutable → elements can be changed.

Immutable Example (Tuple)

my_tuple = ("Apple", "Banana")
print(my_tuple[1])  # Banana
my_tuple[0] = "Orange"  # ❌ TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment


Mutable Example (List)

my_list = ["Apple", 100, 99.9, "Fit"]
print(my_list[1])  # 100

# Changing an element
my_list[1] = 290
print(my_list[1])  # 290

2. List Slicing (Sublist)

Slicing allows you to extract a part of a list.
Syntax: list_name[start:stop]

weight = [1, 2, 3, 5, 9]
print(weight[-3:-1])  # [3, 5]

3. Common List Methods
Method	Description	Example
append()	Adds an element to the end	weight.append(60)
sort()	Sorts in ascending order	weight.sort()
sort(reverse=True)	Sorts in descending order	weight.sort(reverse=True)
reverse()	Reverses the list	age.reverse()
insert(idx, el)	Inserts element at a given index	age.insert(2, 25)
remove(el)	Removes first occurrence of element	fruit.remove("Apple")
pop(idx)	Removes element at index (default last)	fruit.pop(1)

Example:

fruit = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
fruit.remove("Apple")
print(fruit)  # ['Banana', 'Orange']

numbers = [10, 30, 20, 50]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # [10, 20, 30, 50]

4. Tuples
Definition

A tuple is an immutable sequence of values.

Use parentheses () instead of square brackets [].

Once created, tuples cannot be changed.

age = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
print(type(age))  # <class 'tuple'>

# Single-element tuple
weight = (1,)
print(type(weight))  # <class 'tuple'>

Tuple Methods
Method	Description	Example
index(el)	Returns the first index of element	age.index(2)
count(el)	Counts occurrences of element	age.count(1)
purse = ("LV", "Gucci", "Birkin", "LV")
print(purse.index("LV"))  # 0
print(purse.count("LV"))  # 2

5. Practice Exercises
Exercise 1: Favorite Movies

Ask user for 3 favorite movies and store in a list.

movies = []
movies.append(input("Enter your 1st movie: "))
movies.append(input("Enter your 2nd movie: "))
movies.append(input("Enter your 3rd movie: "))
print(movies)

Exercise 2: Favorite Colors

Ask user for 5 favorite colors and store in a list.

colors = []
for i in range(1, 6):
    colors.append(input(f"Enter favorite color {i}: "))
print(colors)

Exercise 3: Numbers Squared

Create a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10.

squares = []
for i in range(1, 11):
    squares.append(i*i)
print(squares)

Exercise 4: Collect Numbers

Ask the user for 5 numbers and store in a list.

numbers = []
for i in range(1, 6):
    numbers.append(int(input(f"Enter number {i}: ")))
print(numbers)

Exercise 5: Multiply by 5

Create a list from 1 to 10 and multiply each number by 5.

numbers = []
for i in range(1, 11):
    numbers.append(i*5)
print(numbers)

Exercise 6: Check for Palindrome

Check if a word in a list is a palindrome (same forwards and backwards).

words = ["racecar", "apple", "mom", "hello"]
for word in words:
    if word == word[::-1]:
        print(f"{word} is a palindrome")
